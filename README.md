Book App Assignment - Lab 11


# Book App - 

**Author**: Jonathon Lee &  Steve Baldock
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Words are food for the brain, and there's no better way to feed one's brain than with a good book. What book should you read, you ask? Well, perhaps we can search for a title or author, or even keyword, and see what options are available for you. 

The **book_app** is designed to fulfill the needs of curious readers. Submit the name of a book or a favorite author and receive suggested books, complete with a photo, the author, title, and a short description. If you want to save the book for an eventual reminder to read the book when you're finished with your current one, simply add the book to your favorites. Perhaps you'd like to take the book off of your favorites list. Simply select delete from the home page. Heck, you can even updated key information about the book if you're feeling frisky. 

Favorited books are stored in a SQL database. Books are automatically rendered to the home page (where favorites are stored). Lastly, each book offers a larger details page that offers additional information about the book. 

## Getting Started
* Create a Github repository complete with a README.md file.
* Clone the new repository to the local machine
* Remember to create a working branch separate from the master
* Create a basic file structure that includes an Index.html, CSS files, and a JavaScript file. 
* Create a Server.js landing file.
* Initiate server by entering the following command in your terminal - **npm init**
* Install all necessary libraries and dependencies, including **express**, **pg**, **superagent**, **dotenv**, and **method-override**
* Initiate and require all necessary dependencies
* Build a basic server, remembering to establish a PORT in the .env file
* Create a SQL database and table, building out a **schema** file.

## Architecture
* This application uses a variety of technology
